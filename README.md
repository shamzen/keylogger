# SCT_CYBER 04 – Basic Keylogger

**Task 04** for my Cyber Security Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.

---

## 📌 Description

**Task:**  
Build a basic keylogger that:
- Records all keystrokes
- Saves them to a local text file

**Why?**  
Understanding how a keylogger works is crucial for security researchers. If you can build it, you can detect it — and stop it.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses the `pynput` library to listen for keyboard events.
- Appends each keystroke to `keylog.txt`.
- Captures normal and special keys (space, enter, etc.).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   3. Observe the `keylog.txt` file for recorded keystrokes.
